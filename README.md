# Applied-Math-Kalman-Filter-Thesis

This repository contains my work exploring **Kalman Filters** as part of my **Applied Mathematics senior thesis** at Colgate University.  
The goal of my thesis was to investigate state estimation techniques, analyzing how Kalman Filters can accurately estimate position and velocity from noisy sensor measurements.  

The repository includes:

- Multiple **1D Kalman Filter implementations**, from simple single-sensor filters to advanced multi-sensor configurations.  
- Scripts for testing **RMSE performance** across multiple runs.  
- Experiments with varying sensor noise, multiple measurement sources, and velocity estimation.  
- Well-commented MATLAB code that demonstrates both theoretical and practical aspects of the filters.  

All scripts are standalone and can be run independently to reproduce the results of my thesis experiments.
